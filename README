Dependencies:
1) OpenCV 3.3.1 build with CUDA support
2) CUDA-Enabled GPU
3) Boost C++ library (for batch file processing)

Usage:
Git does not track empty folders. To use this program in developement, the user must create an Input_Images and an Output_Images folder. Images to process should be placed in the Input_Images folder. Within this folder, images can be organized into subfolders.

Processed images will be saved to the Output_Images folder.

For faster processing of selected images, create a "Selected_Images" folder and place only a few desired images.

Look at the source code for detailed path information.
