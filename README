Dependencies:
1) OpenCV 3.3.1 build with CUDA support
2) CUDA-Enabled GPU
3) Boost C++ library (for batch file processing)

Usage:
Git does not track empty folders. To use this program in developement, the user must create an Input_Images and an Output_Images folder. Images to process should be placed in the Input_Images folder. Within this folder, images can be organized into subfolders.

To process videos, make an "Input_Launch_Videos" and an "Output_Launch_Videos folder in the main directory. Make subfolders in both directories (names must match)

Processed images will be saved to the Output_Images folder.

For faster processing of selected images, create a "Selected_Images" folder and place only a few desired images.

Look at the source code for detailed path information.

If using cameras, use the eclipse_launch script.

COLOR CALIBRATION:
The algorithm will automatically look for a calibration file either in the folder containing the source files, or in the main folder if using the camera. The file must be in the following format:

#Blue
blue_h_low, blue_s_low, blue_v_low
blue_h_high, blue_s_high, blue_v_high
blue_h_ideal, blue_s_ideal, blue_v_ideal

#Pink:
pink_h_low, pink_s_low, pink_v_low
pink_h_high, pink_s_high, pink_v_high
pink_h_ideal, pink_s_ideal, pink_v_ideal

#Yellow:
yellow_h_low, yellow_s_low, yellow_v_low
yellow_h_high, yellow_s_high, yellow_v_high
yellow_h_ideal, yellow_s_ideal, yellow_v_ideal
